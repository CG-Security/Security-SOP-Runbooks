# Vulnerability Management Process

## Purpose
To establish a structured process for identifying, prioritizing, and remediating vulnerabilities.

## Scope
All infrastructure, applications, and endpoints monitored by vulnerability scanning tools.

## Preconditions
- Accurate and updated asset inventory
- Regular vulnerability scans scheduled

## Roles
- Security Analyst: Performs analysis and prioritization
- IT Administrator: Implements remediation
- System Owner: Approves downtime or exceptions

## Procedure
1. Import or review scan results.
2. Validate severity and confirm exploitability.
3. Assign priority based on:
   - CVSS score
   - Exposure
   - Asset criticality
4. Notify system owners of required remediation.
5. Track remediation progress.
6. Re-scan to validate resolution.
7. Document exceptions with justification and expiration dates.

## Evidence Requirements
- Vulnerability reports
- Remediation tracking records
- Exception approvals

## Success Criteria
- Vulnerabilities remediated within defined SLA.
- Exceptions documented and monitored.
- Reduction in recurring findings.
